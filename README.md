### Survival_Analysis

`Survival Analysis` refers to a class of statistical techniques that measure the effect of predictors on the time until an event, rather than the probability of an event occurring. 

There are several applications of this technique in business such as the following
- Time until product failure
- Time until a waranty claim
- Time until a process reaches a critical level
- Tiem from intitial sales contact to a sale
- Time to employee attrition
- Time from a hire to first output e.g time from sales hire to first sale

### Basic Concepts
- Survival Time: The time from a specific starting point (like the start of a study) until the occurrence of the event of interest.
- Censoring: Incomplete information on survival times. For example, if a patient is still alive at the end of a study, their survival time is censored.
- Survival Function (S(t)): The probability that an individual survives beyond time t.
- Hazard Function (Î»(t)): The instantaneous rate at which events occur at time t, given survival up to that time.

More Specifically, we are going to investigate the application of survival analysis in the credit financing industry in this research
